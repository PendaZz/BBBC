            On the back of that, he returned to the Supercats for the 2023 NBL1 South season and helped them to a flying finish to the season despite narrowly missing the finals. He was terrific averaging 20.5 points, 4.6 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.2 steals a game.\n\n

            He has played with Australian team at both the under-17 FIBA World Cup and under-16 Asia Cup. Was coached by Bullets head coach Justin Schueller at the World Cup, so in a lot of ways it was a natural fit for his first foray into the NBL to come with Brisbane.\n\n
            Has continued his development as a combo guard and that included a game this past NBL1 South season at the Nunawading Spectres where he scored 26 points against Andrew Gaze's Melbourne Tigers ahead of moving north to join the Bullets for NBL24.`,
